# Starlight Isle

------------------ Basic Stats ------------------

## Leader or notable persons/entities: 

### Mona: The Leader/chief
The creator and leader of the village. Despite this title no one knows exactly where she came from or who she was before constructing the village. However there are rumors running around that Mona has been running and/or hiding from something for a long time.

### Personality: 

A classic example of a gentle giant is how one might describe Mona. Mona sometimes forgets that in the overworld a woman of her stature isn't exactly the most "normal" thing which results in Mona tending to be quiet self-conscious of her appearance but still many are surprised about how gentle, soft spoken, and even shy of a woman she is despite her size and strength. However as someone wise once said do not mistake kindness for weakness as Mona is every bit as capable to fight off a hoard of attackers in the name of guarding her people. She is very skilled when it comes to fighting with different weapons and even unconventional items, Her favorite form of combat however is hand to hand as she is able to throw enemies around with ease being able to use her strength and size to her advantage. She shows no mercy to those who try and bring harm to her people and those she holds dear, the sudden switch from a calm and soft spoken demeanor to someone who is stone cold in the face of an adversary is frightening to those who witnessed such a switch, although fighting is more of a last resort as she would rather come to a peaceful resolution first before engaging in combat. However another noticeable feature of her's is how exhausted she looks, hooded eyes accompanied by heavy eyebags has people wondering when was the last time she got a good night's rest. Not only that but Mona is known for being a bit "dense". Since english wasn't her first language she is still learning the many sayings, metaphors, and idioms used by the english language and to top it off she takes many things straight forward as many things unintentionally go over her head. She speaks with a heavy accent that no one can really pinpoint for sure where it originated from for sure, however very few are able to recognize that it is in fact some little known form of the enderian language.

-----------------------

### Comet: Her Son
A small 4 ft enderman with an eyepatch over his left eye. After a horrible encounter with 2 humans Comet's eye was taken by force however Mona was able to save him by killing the humans that were hurting the small boy. A few months go by and Mona adopts the small boy as her Son. He can be seen shadowing Mona or with a local babysitter when she's busy.

### Personality:

Shy, quiet, and nervous is how the average person would quickly describe the small boy. Comet is very particular on who he lets get close to him and if you are a stranger you might as well not interact with Comet at all as he is prone to run/teleport away if you get too close. However if Mona is with him and introducing him to you then you may have a chance to have an interaction with him, unfortunately the most you'll probably only get a glance before he clings and hides behind Mona. He is seen constantly twiddling his fingers together and nervously fidgeting in place if Mona is not around or what he deems is close enough and in turn will get very overwhelmed and begin to cry or try and huddle himself into a corner or duck into a nearby room to try and make himself invisible. However, when you peel back the many layers of nervousness and shyness you in fact get a boy who is very curious and excited to explore and discover new things. He loves reading books about insects, plants, animals, rocks, anything he can find and what Mona brings him. He love drawing pictures of things he discovers and constantly asks Mona if they can go explore to try and discover new things together. He's a mama's boy through and through and will constantly be around Mona, he enjoys helping her bake and loves to read to her and vice versa. Comet however doesn't like speaking, at least not in english, while he can read and write just fine it's speaking that's thrown him for a loop. When he tries to speak it's broken and he stumbles with his words resulting in him becoming mute and communicating through either writing or sign language. Although some are able to hear Mona and comet very rarely speak Enderian to one another.   

-----------------------

### Aurora and Dusk: Long time friends
Two imp twins that are polar opposites of one another. Along with that they were one of the first residents to come live in the village and both are very close friends with Mona. Both were also chased away from multiple villages because of their "devil-like features" and had heard about a little rest stop safe from persecution and so sought shelter. They were both one of the first residents to permanently live at Starlight Isle. They are also known to now be the middlewomen for Mona to announce important announcements if she isn't currently available.

### Personalities:

As mentioned above the twins are what are known as polar opposites of one another, however that doesn't take away from the love and adoration they have for one another. Born from the flames of the nether both were wisp like spirits similar to the blazes but both of them wished to flee to the overworld in search of a new life and used an unused Nether portal. So using the unused nether portal fled to the overworld and quickly learned they need to alter their appearances to "fit in". After some time searching they found a witch who agreed to conjure a spell for both of them however they had to give up their blaze rods and the witch got to choose their physical appearance.  

Aurora can be easily described as happy go lucky and full of energy, brimming with excitement and wonder always wanting to try new things from painting to playing an instrument like the trumpet. She has a very large sweet tooth and is always seen snacking and in fact is the reason Mona also loves sweets and pastries as Aurora first introduced her to different types and even taught her how to bake a few recipes. Aurora is extremely clumsy and constantly stresses her sister out with the amount of times she's bumped into objects and nearly dropped very precious items and goods. Along with that she's a hopeless romantic always fantasizing and daydreaming about the day the love of her life will whisk her away to live happily ever after, however despite her outgoing personality whenever she interacts with a "pretty woman" she soon finds herself tongue tied and flustered. 

While Aurora is the sun, her twin sister Dusk is the moon, Dusk is quiet and prefers to keep to herself and lets her sister do all the talking. While Aurora loves to dive into anything new Dusk prefers to stay home and enjoy more quiet and solitary hobbies such as reading, woodworking, and crafting banners on the loom. Once again unlike her sister Dusk is mute and prefers to communicate via sign language and/or writing. She looks over her sister to make sure she doesn't get in over her head or to keep her from embarrassing herself. Dusk is the stronger of the Duo and as such feels it is her responsibility to guard and protect her much more enthusiastic twin from mobs and angry rude villagers.   

-----------------------

### Fahima Yaketsuku: Nemesis 

*Trigger Warning: Mentions of obsessive behavior, stalking* 

unfortunately the rumors of Mona running and hiding from someone or something is true and Fahima is one of those someones. In short Fahima comes from a family who is very powerful in both magic and the sciences who was there and partly responsible for the many deaths of the Neomo people. She conducted experiments, testing, lobotomies, etc etc on the villagers as Mona was one of them. Mona attempted to try and gain Fahima's trust during these few months in order to find some way to escape along with the other, but unfortunately in turn Fahima began to develop feelings for Mona. However after being forced to leave she still hasn't forgotten about Mona and the "innocent" feelings have now turned into a full blown unhealthy obsession. She stops at nothing to gain information on Mona's whereabouts, from destroying villages, killing, manipulating, bribing, and hypnotizing she's willing to do it all in order to find Mona again. And if Mona says no? Oh well, a clear threat to her family and village might help change her mind! If she still refuses? Then I suppose she'll forever be memorialized and preserved in a test tube after a couple of experiments. After all, a corpse can't say no! 

### Personality:

Determined, perfectionist, intelligent, and above all else obsessive are the traits best used to describe this scientist wizard and yet these are the exact traits that make her a serious danger. On the surface she seems carefree and as happy as can be and even then everyone can sense something "upstairs" is broken. As mentioned before she is a perfectionist and always makes sure her plans are perfect and well thought and makes multiple backup plans just in case however if she finds none of her plans are working, even if it's insignificant, her carefree easy going attitude quickly changes to one of rage and impatience. She will yell, insult her assistants, throw objects, and even kill her own assistants if they are too close as they receive the full force of her rage. She's highly intelligent but not only magic, science, and chemistry but she's also a master at manipulating. She's more than willing to manipulate people to get what she wants, whether with magic or none she will constantly use this method to obtain certain materials and information. She plants fake evidence, documents, and photos to help further this tactic. Along with this she is also highly skilled in the use of magic, specifically the magic of pyrogenics otherwise known as fire. Another form of intimidation she will more than happily use her magic to intimidate others to get them to comply. Obsessive is another trait that makes her even more dangerous, she will not stop until she has her answers or what she wants. She will do anything and everything to reach her goal no matter what or who comes across her path. What's even more dangerous is the rage filled tantrum she'll throw when the answers differ from what she wanted originally. 


-----------------------

## Location of town hall or other memorable location: Despite the small village there are still a few remarkable builds

### The Enchanting building: 
Despite some residents owning an enchantment table many still go to this "mystical" building. People claim to have gotten much stronger and desired enchantments while inside this building. Others speak of a calm/serene feeling once stepping into this building as it seems stress and anger slowly seep away. 


### The Moon Fountain: 
A beautiful and simple fountain with all types of flora surrounding it, many residents and even wandering travelers will stop by and make a wish using a small gold coin or any piece of metal they have on hand hoping their wish can come true one day. 


### The Gifts (The Grand Piano and Excavator): 
While not built by the leader of the village or its inhabitants, these two beautiful machines were wonderfully gifted from Kinyakumo's Queen. Due to the advanced tech and sheer size of the contraptions many view the large machines as exhibits being as this small village has little to no knowledge on advanced technology. A fan favorite however seems to be the large piano as many residents will create their own tunes using the happy melodies of the keys. Comet has been seen the most playing around with the piano during the day and sometimes in the evening you can hear him and Mona hum or sing along together to the tune of the piano.


### Founding date: 
When asked, no one is able to pinpoint the exact date this small village became "official" or even when construction began however many reports and witnesses claim and confirm however that they witnessed the village grow over the course of a couple months from a couple small houses to a fully functioning village.

------------------------------------
## Faction Information

### The Birth of the nation: 

 For years ever since Mona had come to the overworld she has been ostracized by each village she had attempted to stay in due to her "otherworldly" appearance, her height and strength caused many people to fear and feel envious of her. While most consider her some sort of alien or monster others were also captivated by her unique appearance or as some claimed it as "otherworldly beauty", however they suspected she would use this beauty in an attempt to hypnotize and/or lure villagers to their demise or to do her bidding. Rumors and lies were spread so much that she would be chased out or forced to move, so in turn she began to use a more "human disguise" in an attempt to try and live a normal life. However this disguise can only last 4-5 hours and is extremely uncomfortable as she shrinks down over 2 feet. Even with this smaller human disguise many people still claimed they felt a different "feeling" or "vibe" when around or near her which once again led others to steer clear from her despite still many finding her captivating for this very reason. After a few incidents of her disguise being compromised and after years of being called a monster and ostracized from numerous she decided enough was enough and finally built herself a house far from any civilizations in order to finally live in peace. However when exploring the areas near her new and upcoming house she found that there was indeed a village near her except it was abandoned and decayed, after looting and taking a look around she left it alone at first. 


 However after a few months of a solitary lifestyle she soon found herself bored after the same day to day routine so she took on the sudden responsibility of rebuilding and refurbishing some of the houses in the decaying village near her home. Soon she began to notice how various travelers would use the newly renovated homes as a place to rest and relax before carrying on with their travels. Soon she began to notice that some of the travelers were facing very similar problems she faced while trying to integrate into the many villages, they were shunned, chased out, and framed to be labeled as monsters. Thus began her mission to try and make these, at the time, few small houses a sanctuary for those just trying to escape ostracization. As more and more travelers stopped by and stayed, Mona began to notice she would need to begin refurbishing more houses to accommodate more travelers so they wouldn't have to worry about space. More time passes and Mona finally has the courage to interact with the oncoming travelers staying, in her human disguise of course, after a few more weeks some of the travelers requested if they could stay there permanently and would like to ask the current owner of the newly built houses. Still in her human disguise Mona would pretend to be the middleman for a while as she helped build more houses and soon other buildings such as a barn, library, church, and many more at the request of the now permanent residents. 


 By day she would parade around the group of residents pretending to be a middleman while at night she took it upon herself to be responsible for guarding the entirety of the growing village from mobs, pillargers, and even other travelers looking to raid and loot. However people began to whisper of a mysterious figure seen walking around the border at night and Mona knew it was only a matter of time before she had to come clean and with the growing insistent pleas to see the true "owner" of the now newly operational village Mona had planned to reveal herself soon enough now growing tired of lying. Finally after some time Mona decided to reveal herself and come clean, she explained that it was in fact her the entire time only in a human disguise as she didn't want the others to fear her or despise her for her appearance. While some were still in shock and admittedly intimidated by her true size most were rather grateful towards her. In their words she helped them create a home safe from prejudice of others, a sanctuary where they didn't have to worry about being ostracized or chased out again. She built them homes, a farm, a library, bakery, and much more all at the request of the villagers. She helped appoint positions, and offered many others jobs with these new buildings. After an outpouring of thanks all the Villagers agreed that it was only right to have Mona be named leader and/or Cheif of this new village which she had now named Starlight Isle.

## Top 3-5 things about your nation

*This is kinda of a TLDR where you list your top 5 things that are unique or different about your nation. Be creative!*

* The Slogan: *"May peace forever reign and prosperity forever grow"*

* Much of the village's income comes from trading and/or selling the natural resources they grow, sell, and make. Wine, honey, baked goods, crops, livestock etc etc. 

* Starlight Isle is known as a sanctuary for all sorts of people and creatures, hybrids, witches, wizards etc etc are all come here to escape persecution and lead a normal lifestyle while using their unique strengths and abilities to help the village grow and prosper.  

* The Sakura trees surrounding the village were planted by Mona, unlike in her original home, there was no pink cherry wood or sakura like trees in general, so seeing the vibrant color captivated her as she very quickly fell in love with the cherry blossom trees and their falling petals. Thus she began to plant the trees around her home before using it to construct her village which is why there is a lot of Cherry wood seen.  

* subconsciously Mona built Starlight Isle in the image of her old home in an attempt to try and rebuild what she has lost. 

------------------------------------ 

## Mona's Origin and Abilities 

### The Origin:

*TRIGGER WARNING: Mentions of death, genocide, body horror, and corpses.*

Mona grew up in another section of the End in a small village known as the Neomo Village as a normal everyday villager. She lived with her mother (Almajara) and was engaged to her Fiance (Aelius). Unfortunately this peace would not last long as a group of mercenaries who were hired by 2 powerful families to exterminate and gather data on the people's "supernatural abilities" came and captured and seized the village. After capturing all the villagers the mercenaries held them for weeks waiting for the rest of their crew to arrive which was a group of scientists before being given the orders to "begin the trials" and thus the torture began. Men, women, children, no one was spared from the vicious treatment at the hands of these cruel people. Experiments were being led on their bodies and abilities, lobotomies conducted to see their inner biology and how they differed from the average human. Testing was just as inhumane as many were pumped full of unknown drugs to see how they affected their bodies and of course the ring. The ring was used to force the Neomo people to face off against one another under or not under the effects of certain drugs and potions to see how it affected their strength, knowledge, agility, and situational awareness. 


At the same time they had begun to purge and take the natural resources of the land along with taking and killing a majority of the life that was unique to this area which in turn caused most if not all of the unique wildlife to become extinct and preserved within jars and vials. Months and Months of this cruel treatment went by as Mona was forced to watch the friends and people she grew up with get picked off one by one at the hands at either the scientists, mercenaries, one another in the ring, and sadly by their own hands as many people couldn't take the pain of what was being forced upon them and thus took their own lives. Locked in a cage where all she could do was listen to the screams and wails of her fellow people as they were tortured and experimented on, on top of that some of the mercenaries would mock Mona and many others in the cages for "being to weak" or "being nothing more than cadavers for us to use".


Mona dealt with the experimentations, the testings, and even was forced to fight in the ring against fellow villagers and even her own mother who in turn took her own life inside the ring knowing both of them would be put through even more experimentations and testings as punishment. All of this day after day no doubt began to have its effect on Mona as she was one of the last people alive alongside her fiance and 6 others who managed to survive the horrors they were forced to endure and partake in. Labeled as the finale 8 and the "strongest" of the entire village they were put through more intense and brutal testing and experimenting and soon were whittled down to 2 leaving Mona and her fiance. As you guessed it her fiance was chosen next as he was taken to be experimented on however Mona refused to let him be taken and began to scream and cling onto him as she began to kick, bite, scratch, and scream, anything to try and keep them from taking away Aelius however it was all in vain as many of the remaining mercenaries restrained her using chains and dosed her with a sedative to limit her movements. Despite this all she could do was wail as she heard the screams of her fiance before passing out. 


Once waking up she was met with silence as she expected to be met with her badly beaten husband however all she was met with was two guards looking down on her as they tossed the now bloody engagement ring on the floor. The message was clear as Mona quickly picked up the ring and began to sob as the two guards laughed as she wept, taunting and teasing as she continued to weep. After that Mona felt something within her snap, if she was willing to tell you she could've sworn she heard the sound of a rope snapping. Full of anger and sadness she soon began to transform into her half shifted form as the guards could only watch in shock and horror as Mona began to grow over 10 feet and sprout dragon-like features, horns, claws, a tail, and of course a set of wings. This combined with her adrenaline and extra strength she quickly laid waste to the cage she was in and the guards that were taunting her. Not long after she slaughtered everyone who was left at the now decimated village. All Mona could see was red, all she could feel was rage coursing through her as she ripped each and every mercenary that was left. Their screams echoed throughout their camp and the now destroyed village as their attempts to fight and kill Mona was in vain. As she finished off killing the last of the group there and as the adrenaline wore off and everything finally hit her. 


She was alone. As far as she was concerned she was the last woman standing. Everyone was dead, piles of corpses lay stacked upon one another in a yet to be covered ditch and there were more mounds of dirt where even more bodies have been buried. broken and decaying homes, destroyed wildlife, and more burned down buildings, it was then when she fell to her knees and let out screams of agony. She was all alone now, no one had made it and all that was left of her home was ashes, ruins, and piles of corpses that were once her friends now lay lifeless. After screaming for who knows how long she suddenly went stone cold as she slowly made her way towards the pile of corpses before picking up each corpse one by one and began to dig graves for each person. To make matters worse some of the corpses she found had missing limbs, cut open, or just damaged beyond recognition. Hours, days even Mona spent digging and burying her fellow Neomo people. 


Reuniting children with their parents, connecting lovers, placing friends next to one another, anything she could do to at least comfort them in death. Grabbing what remaining flora was left she attempted to decorate the graves she had made before going to grab the final person, her fiance. Shakely going toward the room meant for testing she slowly opened the door and the sight before her made her fall to her knees and weep. There he lay on an strapped to an autopsy table cut open and as his face was locked into a permanent scream and look of horror. She quickly rushed over to his body and held his hand as gentle as she could with her claws before apologizing. After a few moments she finally got the courage to free him from his binds and carry him out into the open before digging a grave and gently laying him inside as she gave him one last kiss. After sitting amongst the mass of graves only one thing was on her mind, revenge and retribution. 


Using the portal mercenaries used to get to her home she quickly ran into it and thus was her first time in the overworld. Her first day in the overworld was not pleasant. After exiting the portal she quickly killed 2 humans who unluckily stumbled upon the portal. While rummaging through their belongings she found maps leading to nearby villages they had stopped by at. She had her next targets. She destroyed and massacred 2 villages that day, no one was spared despite them being innocent and unknowing of what their fellow humans had put her and the Neomo people through. However by a stroke of pure luck she managed to find that one of the guards that imprisoned her lived there, he was saved for last. She restrained them and forced them to watch and listen to the screams and destruction of their family and home before Mona finally walked up to them. 


*“How…HOW DARE YOU ENJOY WHAT YOU TOOK SO BRUTALLY FROM ME, Now because of your choices your people have suffered a fate worse than death..a fate caused by you.”*


After everything she passed out and woke up a few days later covered in blood and horrified at what she had done, however she simply had no more tears to spare as she quickly ran away as far away as she could from the scene where she now tried to lead a normal life, running from what she had done. 


### The Dragon. 
Despite Mona looking almost exactly like her mother there is one major thing she was gifted by her father, the ability to be able to shift into a dragon. However with her father having passed away before he was able to guide her in controlling these abilities and with the massacre of her village no one was able to teach her how to harness these abilities and safely transform at will rendering her knowledge of how to control such forms and abilities little to impossible. Followed by the genocide of 2 villages at her hands she has refused to attempt to learn at all believing that trying to suppress it and forget about it would help solve the issue. However it couldn't be farther from the truth, when half shifted and in full dragon form her mind has become so fractured that she has a hard time processing who is a friend/ally/innocent bystander from the faces of the mercenaries who hurt her and destroyed her home. 


If you see her in such a state it is best advised to stay away from her at all costs but if you find yourself in a confrontation with her the best course of action is to show and say that you mean no harm she will hopefully begin to see the face of her friend, former or present, or run away ashamed with herself that she couldn't discern who was a friend or foe. If you instead show signs of attacking or defending she might take that as a sign you might try and hurt her therefore will attack without holding back until she snaps out of it or runs away. Because of these setbacks Mona has promised herself to try her best to keep this problem to herself and refuses help in fear of becoming a bother/annoyance to her friends. Only Aurora and Dusk know about this problem yet Mona has sworn them to secrecy in order to keep this problem contained. Another side effect of this is that Mona will wander in a daze similar to sleepwalking in an attempt to try and find another way "home". She will wander miles and miles without rest until she passes out from exhaustion or someone snaps her out of the sleepwalking state. 

-- *Half Shifted 
Height*: 10 ft (when hunched over) / 10'9 (when standing upright) 


-- *Full Dragon form 
Height*: 168 Ft

## Abilities: 

### Void spikes/vines 

As the name suggests these spikes and vines look similar to the sculk you find in caves and it goes without saying that these protrusions are extremely sharp and jagged. However they are able to move under the command of Mona as they are able to attack and defend. It is advised to not touch or interact with either of these as both may have a chance of infecting you. 


### The Sickness

As mentioned above depending on the emotional state Mona is in while shifted the strain could either be very strong or very weak. If the strain is strong enough and you come into contact with the sickness in simple terms your limbs one by one would be overridden and you will soon find as though you are being puppeted by someone or something. People, animals, and even plants are not safe from this stronger strain as they belong to a hive mind connected to Mona thus it will do her bidding. If you're lucky and the strain is weaker than a few simple potions of regeneration and golden apples should do the trick. However it will still be excruciatingly painful and you will feel sore a few days after you have been cured and in some cases might leave a scar(s) behind. It is akin to looking like black vines along whichever limb was infected. However another interesting thing is that no one can remember how and when they had gotten "sick", not only that but some claim they felt like they were asleep the entire time while having these weird psychedelic dreams. 


### Flight

As expected when shifting Mona is able to sprout wings and take flight however this process is extremely painful as skin tears and bones rearrange to sprout her wings which stretch out to be 2.4 meters in length. However she is able to use her wings to slice through some materials and even people if she has enough speed. Another unique feature is that while in flight she is completely silent akin to an owl, this skill makes it much easier to sneak up and swope in towards an enemy taking them out quickly and silently. That is, if Mona's able to control herself, in most cases she will ambush or just straight up attack you with no mercy. 


### Atomic Breath

To get a more clear picture some of you may know the famous monster Godzilla, well this ability takes direct inspiration from his famous Atomic breath. Now with an ominous purple and black glow this power is just as deadly even more so if she is shifted into full dragon form. Unfortunately this move also leaves slight traces of radiation behind along with strains of the illness. Very few materials are able to withstand the immense heat and radiation from this attack and if you are in the line of fire than I hope your reflexes are incredible because if not you'll never see the sun rise again. 


### Corrosive acid

Along with the atomic breath she is able to shoot streams and/or bursts of corrosive acid that is able to melt most materials with ease which include organic matter. Buildings, plants, animals, humans, are melted down with ease and within seconds after coming into contact. However if this acid manages to just barely scrape you not only will it sting horribly it'll begin to infect you with the illness as well, from there you can only hope it is a weaker strain. 


### Third eye

The third eye is essentially used as a gateway to see from the illness point of view, for instance, say someone or an animal is under control of her virus and from there this third eye allows her to see things from their POV. Not only that but if you stare into it you will be frozen as if in a trance. However this can be avoided if you simply avoid eye contact with this third eye although because of the grotesque nature of said eye it's hard for many to look away. 

### The call of the dead

The last and most painful ability Mona possesses when in her shifted forms, this power allows her to call upon the spirits of those who have fallen with an earth shattering roar, the roar is not only the one of a monster but underneath you can hear Mona's voice screaming in agony and frustration. The spirits coming to her aid are the ones who were massacred in her original home, with this awakening roar they will burst from the ground and run towards whoever or whatever Mona perceives as the enemy. They will fight with great strength and use moves and techniques they knew when alive and the most detrimental aspect of this is that these spirits will begin to slowly drain the life force of their enemies the longer they engage. Essentially they will take away the souls of their adversaries leaving nothing but a husk of what they once were. However Mona refuses to use this move under any circumstances as she feels it is disturbing them from resting peacefully in the afterlife. To her they've been through hell enough and she doesn't want to make them go through anymore suffering while on the other hand the spirits out of love, respect, and admiration are more than willing to help Mona take down and destroy her adversaries so she will no longer be in agony and under attack.
